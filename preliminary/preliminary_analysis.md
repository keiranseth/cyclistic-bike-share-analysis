# Preliminary Analysis

This preliminary analysis deliverable contains the rough gathering of insights from the cleaned dataset, conveyed using the form of question and answer.

See the figures obtained in this report [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WOKB3_DJXcglaHmOiyEX2y2Bf1aIcE8D/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102786533366214242942&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Insights

-   A majority of the riders use classic bikes, than electric bikes and electric scooters.
-   The ride duration is higher during the weekends (`Sunday` and `Saturday`) compared to the weekdays.
-   The number of riders are higher during `Wednesday` and `Saturday`.

Comparison between casual riders and members:

-   There are more members than casual riders.
-   Among riders who use classic and electric bikes, members are greater than casual riders.
-   Among riders who use electric scooters, casual riders are greater than members.
-   While there are around `76%` more members than casual riders, casual riders have `100%` longer ride durations than members.

</figure><br><br><br>

> There are no discernible patterns to be gained from looking at the rider counts by bike type.
>
> However, what is clear is that, across the entire week, classic bikes are used more often, electric bikes are used significantly but not as much as classic bikes, and lastly, electric scooters are less often.

> Knowing that months `May` to `October` were the peak months, it makes sense that quarters `2` and `3` would be the peak quarters, exceeding a million users in one quarter.

>
> The average ride duration in 2024 is `16` minutes and `39` seconds.
>
> The longest ride duration in 2024 is `25` hours, `9` minutes, and `22` seconds.

### 6. What are the total and average ride durations in terms of membership type?

<figure>
    <img src="./images/image-22.png"
         alt="The total and average ride duration Partitioned by Membership">
    <figcaption><em>The total and average ride duration Partitioned by Membership</em></figcaption>
</figure><br><br><br>

> The total ride duration by casual riders in 2024 is `609,957` hours, `45` minutes, and `59` seconds. Their average ride duration in `24` minutes and `3` seconds.
>
> The total ride duration by members in 2024 is `558,416` hours, `35` minutes, and `43` seconds. Their average ride duration in `12` minutes and `28` seconds.
>
> Even though the casual riders are outnumbered by members by a half, their average ride duration is `100%` longer and their total ride duration is greater.

### 7. What are the total, average, and maximum ride durations in terms of bike type?

</figure><br><br><br>

> Since we already know that classic bikes are used most often, electric bikes are used second most often, and electric scooters are used rarely, it's not surprising that this is also reflected in their respective total and average ride durations.

### 8. How do these total, average, and maximum ride durations differ in terms of both membership type and bike type?

> The observations that casual riders bike longer than members are also observed across the three bike types.
